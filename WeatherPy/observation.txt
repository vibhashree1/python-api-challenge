Observations
Temperature shows a distinct correlation with latitude, both in the Northern (-0.82) and Southern (0.77) hemispheres with a decrease in temperature as we move away from the equator.
Wind speed appears to slightly increase as we move away from the equator.
Both cloudiness (0.05-0.08) and humidity (0.07-0.08) appear to have little correlation to latitude.
